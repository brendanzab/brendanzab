## About me

:wave: Hello, I'm Brendan! ([he/him](https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him))

Currently I'm working as an industrial programming language researcher at [YesLogic](https://yeslogic.com) making [Fathom](https://github.com/yeslogic/fathom), a dependently typed binary data description language that compiles to Rust. In my spare time I tinker with [procedural world generation](https://voyager3.tumblr.com/), draw [pictures of houses](https://www.instagram.com/brendanzab/), and work on my programming language, [Pikelet](https://github.com/pikelet-lang/pikelet/).
